# DirtAI: Unearthing the Potential of AI for Sustainable Agriculture

Welcome to DirtAI, where we blend artificial intelligence with topics such as permaculture, agroforestry, and biodiversity to promote a greener future. We invite you to join our thriving community as we explore and champion sustainable earth practices.

## About

DirtAI is a platform dedicated to bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and earth sciences. We offer articles, resources, and community discussions focused on leveraging AI for sustainable agriculture and related fields. 

Our platform is open-source and hosted on GitHub. The content is served as a static GitHub page, making it easy for anyone to contribute, modify, and improve.
